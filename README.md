# SimpleNeuroEvolutionarySimulation

This is a as conceptually simple neural network, with a evolutionary trainer, as I could create. I did it as experiment to learn more about neural networks and could be used as training example.

It can "solve" any problem that implements the *Task* interface. Included is a extreamly simple game.
